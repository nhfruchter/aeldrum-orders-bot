**Orders**
• **!sendorder ...** will send an order to the DM channel with all text and attachments. Orders are attributed to your faction as specified by Discord role.
• **!sendorder[Another Faction] ...** lets attribute your order to a different faction.

**Affiliation**
• **!faction ...** will override your default affiliation (as set by Discord role).
• **!faction check** will tell you what faction your orders are tagged as.
• **!faction clear** will remove any affiliation (and default back to Discord role).

**Turns**
• **!turn *n*  **specifies a turn number which will appear with your order. Turns are attached to your user, not your factions or your channels. 
• **!turn clear** will remove turn data associated with your user. 
• **!turn check** will tell you what turn you've specified, if any.

**Global Settings**
• **!turn default *n* **specifies a default turn that applies to all users without an explicitly set turn.
• **!turn default clear** removes turn data associated with the default turn.
    
Happy backstabbing!
